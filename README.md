# SBpiper - R package for SBpipe

## Introduction

R code for SBpipe (see: [https://pdp10.github.io/sbpipe](https://pdp10.github.io/sbpipe)). 
This package contains a collection of R utility functions that SBpipe uses for plotting and generating statistical results. Originally, this source code was distributed within SBpipe. 
SBpiper was conceived to improve modularity and allows users to call SBpipe functions for data analysis and plot generation directly as an R library.
