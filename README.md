## Introduction

R code for SBpipe (see: [https://pdp10.github.io/sbpipe](https://pdp10.github.io/sbpipe)). 
This package contains a collection of R utility functions used by SBpipe 
for plotting and generating statistics. Originally, this source code was distributed within SBpipe. 
SBpiper was conceived to improve modularity and enable the invokation of SBpipe functions for data analysis and plot generation directly as an R library.

## Using SBpipe
This dependency library is automatically installed by SBpipe via provided script or using conda, so no further step is needed. See the above link for instructions on how to install SBpipe. 

## Using SBpiper as an R library
The below information should be used by those users who intend to use this library directly in their 
R source code and do NOT plan to install SBpipe.
SBpiper can directly be installed via github:
```
> install.packages("devtools")
> devtools::install_github("pdp10/sbpiper")
```

or via conda:
```
$ conda install -c pdp10 sbpiper
```

The R package is loaded as usual:
```
> library(sbpiper)
```

Developers can check and build SBpiper using the following commands: 
```
> devtools::check("sbpiper")
> devtools::build("sbpiper")
````

Finally, sbpiper is installed with the command: 
```
$ `R CMD INSTALL sbpiper_X.Y.Z.tar.gz`
```

Conda recipe for SBpiper retrieves the code from the `master` branch its the github repository. Therefore, before building the conda package, make sure that the `master` is updated with the new version. Anaconda client is needed and can be installed with the following commands:

$ anaconda login
```
Build conda package:
```
$ conda-build conda_recipe/meta.yaml
```
